# <ins> Salary prediction using tree based models </ins>

As part of my master degree in Management I wrote a thesis on the applications of **Machine Learning in the field of Human Recourse Management**.
After an extensive literature, I trained my own **tree-based models to predict salaries**.
Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting tree were compared.
-	**Gradient Boosting** tree obtained the best performance
-	Variables linked to the **position** in the organisation were the most influential in making the prediction

This thesis obtained a grade of 16/20. It was my first hands-on introduction to Python and Machine Learning. A condensed version is presented here.
